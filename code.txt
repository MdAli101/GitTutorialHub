What to do if we wanna unstag our files.
    git restore --staged delete_now.txt

if we somehow working and we foundt that oh no we have deleted one of the most
important file so, what is the backup:
    Backup is that we can unmodify our file by doing:
        git checkout -- delete_now.txt  //this code will insert the data of file of the last commited one.
        (you will insert your files name here)

if we have modified gitignore and than checked it out by the code git checkout -- gitignore.txt
than it won't restore it because it's a git privacy feature.

if we have done a lot of coding and than we have to goto our previous code/commit
than we will run :
    git checkout -f
