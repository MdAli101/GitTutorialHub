push = giving codes in gitHub
pull = taking codes from gitHub to our computer

Push an existing repository from the command line
    git remote add origin https://github.com/MdAli101/GitTutorialHub.git

    here git will remote add this link as the name of origin

checking url(s):
    git remote -v
    it will show 2 url one for pull and one for push.
